    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>Have you ever thought to yourself, why am I buying a lottery ticket? There is absolutely no chance that I'm going to win?  Well we have, and
      then we thought, why not create a place where people can bet that no one will win, and that’s what we did.</p>

    <h2>But how does it work?</h2>
    <p>Smart people like you sign up to our site and deposit some money into their account wallet, they then decide if they think someone will match
      all 6 numbers in the UK national lottery draw.  If you think they will then you bet 'Yay', and if you think they won't then you bet 'Nay'.<p>
    <p>The site will show you the estimated return of a possible £10 bet for both the Yay or the Nay.  Note that the return will vary depending on
      how many people agree or disagree with you or disagree before the draw closes.</p>

    <h2>When does the draw close?</h2>
    <p>The betting stops half an hour before the National Lottery draw on a Saturday night to give us time to work out the final numbers.</p>

    <h2>Then what happens?</h2>
    <p>If you were correct, either claiming that no one would win the jackpot and no one did, or that someone would win and they did, then you win a
      share of the prize pot.  The prize pot is allocated out based on the size of your bet, i.e. someone betting £20 would get twice the return of
      someone betting £10.</p>
    <p>Once our processing has been completed after the draw the winnings will be deposited into the player wallets.</p>

    <h2>Can I then have my money back?</h2>
    <p>Of course! You can withdraw your funds back to your payment provider.</p>
